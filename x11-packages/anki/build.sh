# The pure-Python dependencies of anki and aqt are not packaged by Termux, per
# the packaging policy on language-specific package managers, so they are
# installed from PyPI by the generated postinst script.
#
# Of the 31 distributions in the runtime closure, three publish no pure-Python
# wheel and would otherwise be compiled on device: orjson and rpds-py (Rust)
# and markupsafe (C). Those are packaged separately and listed as ordinary
# dependencies above, so nothing has to be built at install time.
